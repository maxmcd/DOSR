#About

DOSR is a cosmetically deficient (hopefully a temporary condition), open source, REPL application for the desktop built on NW.js and AngularJS. It currently supports Javascript, Python, Ruby, and R.

Note: gist button requires the ruby gem `gist` be installed. To do this, simply execute `$ gem install gist`. To associate gists with your account run `gist --login` and complete authentication. All this assumes ruby is installed as well.
